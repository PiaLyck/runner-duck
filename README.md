Slugs are taking over your garden. Have no fear, Indian Runner Ducks are here!

### This project was made to learn and have fun with:
* [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - A powerful layout system available in CSS. It's a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.

### Objective
* Must make use of grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-column, grid-row and grid-area, and be fully responsive (ie. tablet and mobile friendly).
* Design, color, content and overall appearances not important.
